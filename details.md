### **Project Brief: PSRA Website Development**

**To the Developer:**

This document contains the complete instructions for building the official website for the Pharmaceutical Studies and Research Association (PSRA). The primary goal is to create a professional, informative, and functional online platform for students, researchers, and potential partners.

A key requirement for this project is a **minimalist, professional, and academic aesthetic**. All styling should be kept simple, using a strict black, white, and grayscale color palette.

---

### **1. General Design & Styling Guidelines**

*   **Color Palette:**
    *   **Primary Background:** White (`#FFFFFF`) or a very light gray (`#F4F4F4`).
    *   **Primary Text:** Black (`#000000`) or a very dark gray (`#212121`).
    *   **Secondary Text/Accents:** Medium Gray (`#888888`) for things like timestamps, metadata, or placeholders.
    *   **Borders & Lines:** Light Gray (`#CCCCCC`).
    *   **Buttons/Links (Hover):** A slightly darker gray background on hover to indicate interactivity. No color.

*   **Typography:**
    *   **Font Family:** Use a clean, standard sans-serif font like **Lato**, **Open Sans**, or **Arial**. Ensure it's web-safe and legible.
    *   **Headings (H1, H2, H3):** Bold weight. Keep sizes proportional and clean.
    *   **Body Text:** Regular weight. A comfortable size for reading (e.g., 16px).

*   **Layout & Spacing:**
    *   Use a grid-based layout for consistency and alignment.
    *   Be generous with whitespace to create a clean, uncluttered feel.
    *   The website must be fully responsive and functional on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

*   **Imagery:**
    *   **ALL IMAGES** used on the site, including photos of team members and background images, must be **desaturated to black and white**. This is a critical instruction to maintain the "dull" and professional aesthetic.

### **2. Asset Management**

The following image files are provided. They should be optimized for the web and used as specified below.

*   `logo.png`: The official PSRA logo. To be used in the header and footer.
*   `image1.jpg` & `image2.jpg`: General-purpose images.
    *   Use one of these for the Home page hero section background (desaturated).
    *   The other can be used on the "Collaborate with Us" or "About Us" page as a banner or illustrative image (desaturated).
*   **Team Member Photos (JPGs):** These files correspond to the team members and contributors. They must be used on the "About Us" page.
    *   `Abrar Mohammed_Salih Ahmed.jpg`

### **6. Forum Mechanics & Design (`/forum`)**

This is the most complex functional part of the site. It requires a backend and database.

#### **A. Database Schema (Conceptual):**

*   `users`: (id, name, email, password_hash, profile_picture_url, created_at)
*   `posts`: (id, user_id, category, title, content, created_at)
*   `comments`: (id, post_id, user_id, content, created_at)
*   `likes`: (user_id, post_id) - A simple table to track likes.

#### **B. Forum Main Page (`/forum`)**

*   **Layout:** Two-column layout as described in the brief.
*   **Left Column (Sticky Navigation):**
    *   Search Bar (`Search Discussion`).
    *   Category Links: `Pharmacology`, `Clinical Pharmacy`, `Research Skills`. Clicking these should filter the posts shown in the right column.
*   **Right Column (Content Feed):**
    *   Breadcrumb navigation at the top (e.g., `Forum > Pharmacology`).
    *   "Start New Discussion" button (visible only to logged-in users). This could open a modal or lead to a new page to create a post.
    *   A list of posts, ordered by most recent.
    *   **Post Preview Card:** Should show:
        *   Author's Name & Profile Picture (small circle).
        *   Timestamp (e.g., "posted 2 hours ago").
        *   Post Title (clickable, linking to the full post page `/forum/post/{id}`).
        *   A short snippet of the post content.
        *   Like and Comment counts.

#### **C. Single Post Page (`/forum/post/{id}`)**

*   Displays the full content of the selected post (text, images, files).
*   Below the post, display the "Like" and "Comment" buttons.
*   Below that, show a list of all comments for that post.
*   At the bottom, a "Write a message..." text area for logged-in users to add a new comment.

#### **D. User Authentication Pages**

*   **Login (`/forum/login`):**
    *   A centered form with: `Email/Username` field, `Password` field, `Forgot Password?` link, `Login` button, and a link below saying `Don't have an account? Create one`.
*   **Registration (`/forum/register`):**
    *   A centered form with fields for: `Email`, `Name`, `Password`, `Confirm Password`.
    *   An optional "Upload Profile Picture" field.
    *   A checkbox: `I agree to the <a href="/forum/terms">Terms and Conditions</a>`. This must be checked to enable the "Create Account" button.
*   **Terms & Conditions (`/forum/terms`):**
    *   A static page displaying all the forum rules as provided in the brief.

#### **E. Forum Functionality**

*   **User Roles:**
    *   **Guest:** Can view posts and comments. Cannot create posts, comment, or like.
    *   **Registered User:** Can do everything a guest can, plus create posts, comment on posts, and like posts.
    *   **Admin/Moderator:** Can delete or edit any post/comment that violates the rules. (This requires a backend admin panel).
*   **Posting:** Logged-in users should be able to create new posts with text and optionally upload one image per post.
*   **Commenting:** Logged-in users can add text-based comments to any post.
*   **Liking:** The like button should be a toggle. Clicking it adds a like; clicking again removes it. The total like count should update dynamically (using JavaScript).
